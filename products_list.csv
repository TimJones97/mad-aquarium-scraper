Aquael Pat Mini Filter 400lph,1,"AQUAEL presents a revolutionary new line of internal aquarium filters.The  ASAP filters combine high performance and great usability features with  a clever design that reduces the time required for maintenance works. 

The ASAP internal filter consists of a modern energy-efficient motor placed in a stylish housing and a large transparent filter bowl filled with carefully chosen filtration sponge. 
The sponge is quickly populated by beneficial bacteria, so water passing through the filter undergoes biological as well as mechanical filtration. Thanks to that, it stays clear and safe for the inhabitants of the aquarium. The filter requires two basic types of maintenance procedures. One consists in removing the filter bowl and replacing it with a new one (we offer standard cartridges as well as cartridges with activated carbon or phosphate absorber to prevent the growth of algae). The other involves the rinsing of filtration sponge in water drained from the tank. This operation can be performed without the need to remove the entire filter from the aquarium tank, which is very convenient and significantly reduces maintenance time.

Add 1 pellet per 1/4 inch of growth, never  feeding more than 5 pellets at one feeding. Additional feedings can be  made if they are at least three hours apart and at least that amount of  time before all lights are out in the room. During feedings, feed one  pellet at a time and make sure the betta completely consumes each  pellet. Do not overfeed. Overfeeding can be detrimental to the betta and  the water quality. Remove any uneaten food after the feeding period.Maintenance: Bettas are called ""fighting  fish"" because the males fight with one another. You should never keep  males together for this reason, but can keep a single betta with other  non-aggressive fish in a larger aquarium. Keep your water at a low to  moderate acidity and maintain a temperature between 73°F (23°C) and 81°F  (27°C) free of drafts or rapid temperature changes. Change some water  weekly with a water conditioner to remove chloramines, chlorine and  ammonia that is the same temperature as the water you are replacing. We  suggest a bowl size no smaller than 30 ounces but prefer something  larger.Suitable For:All Discus Varieti"

Shrimp Flakes include both shrimp and krill, providing the fish with  maximum aquatic protein content to support healthy growth. They contains  a broad spectrum of all the important components needed in marine and  freshwater fish diets: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and  minerals. Also included in Shrimp Flakes is the Seachem’s product, GarlicGuard, which is not only a natural attractant, but also helps to protect the fish against bacterial and parasitic infections. Vitamin C is an especially important factor in the growth and health of aquatic animals, and is present in high levels in NutriDiet Shrimp Flakes. This vitamin is a cofactor in the processes necessary for the formation of connective tissue, scar tissue in wound repair, and bone matrix. In a natural diet, vitamin C is hard to obtain but critical in addressing healing and growth in many fish.

This algae contains extremely high levels of enzymes, vitamins, and minerals including the full vitamin B complex. It is far superior to the Spirulina algae common to many flake foods available on the market.Shrimp Flakes contain probiotics which allow for more rapid and simplistic digestion of the partner nutrients. Less energy is required by the fish to digest the food. The food is more completely digested allowing for less waste production in the aquarium.

Instant Baby Brine Shrimp,1,"Description:
New Life Spectrum Tropical Fish Diet.

Features & Benefits:
Baby brine shrimp (nauplii of Artemia salina) are widely used in the aquarium hobby as food during the first stages of many delicate fishes and for invertebrates. To this date, there has been little or no innovation in the use of Baby Brine Shrimp in the hobby.

The whole process of hatching brine shrimp cysts at home can be tedious and cumbersome. More often than not, due to variables such as improper storage, the hatching rate can be rather disappointing. The next challenge facing the hobbyist is synchronizing the hatching time with first feeding of the fry. Those days are over. Ocean Nutrition has developed the Instant Baby Brine Shrimp, a revolutionary off the shelf product that allows you to use brine shrimp when and where you need them. The product consists entirely of sterile newborn nauplii in an aqueous solution. The nauplii have a very good buoyancy, as if you are dealing with a live product!!The product can be kept and stored at room temperature. Once open, the product must be kept in the refrigerator. To avoid any quality issues make sure that the security strip is complete at the time of purchase.Ingredients:Baby Brine Shrimp (Artemia nauplii).Suitable For:Delicate small fish, fish fry and invertebrate"

1 Year Combo Alert,1,"Description:
Seachem 1 Year Combo Alert is a constant updating indicator for pH and Ammonia.

Features & Benefits:
Freshwater PH and Ammonia ReadingsSeachem Sensor TechnologyContinuously Monitors Ammonia and Freshwater PHNo Tests, No StripsIn the absence of free ammonia the unit will assume a yellow or faint yellow-green color. It is normal for the dry sensor to have a greenish hue. It may take up to a few days for a dry sensor to equilibrate with the water.

No sampling of water, chemicals, or test procedures are  required. The presence of the free ammonia is detectable continuously  with a response time of about 15 minutes. Response to decreasing ammonia  is slower, requiring about 4 hours to go from TOXIC to SAFE on removal  of ammonia. Ammonia Alert® lasts over 9 times as long as competing  products (over a year compared to 4-6 weeks). Ammonia Alert® is also  almost half the size of competing products (1.5"" x 2.5""). It's small,  clear, and unobtrusive, so it won't detract from the view of your  aquarium.InterpretationAs little as 0.02 mg/L of free ammonia will produce a  greenish hue on the detector surface. This corresponds to a total  ammonia (both ionized and free ammonia) of 0.25 mg/L in marine water at  pH 8.3. In freshwater at pH 7.0, this corresponds to 3.6 mg/L total  ammonia. Free ammonia is much more toxic than ionized ammonia. As free  ammonia, the ALERT color corresponds to about 0.05 mg/L, ALARM to about  0.2 mg/L, and TOXIC to about 0.5 mg/L. The ALERT concentration is  tolerated for several days, ALARM for a few days, and TOXIC is rapidly  harmful. For emergency ammonia removal, treat with AmGuard™. This product is not recommended for use at acid pH.CareNo care is required beyond removing algae with a clean,  soft material. Avoid touching the sensor with fingers, since skin oils  can damage it. Do not use bleach, soap, detergents or hard objects to  clean the sensor. Some dye medications may discolor the sensor.  Sensitivity improves with age, provided the unit is not allowed to dry  out, however, drying does not permanently impair the unit. For maximum  sensitivity, the unit should be read under natural daylight or daylight  simulating light. Red enhancing light minimizes green and blue hues,  decreasing the apparent sensitivity of the unit. The response of the  unit may be checked by holding it briefly over the mouth of an ammonia  bottle: color should develop rapidly.PH AlertpH Alert® is a unique color device designed to be placed in  the aquarium or filter and monitor pH continuously.

Easy-Life Easy Carbo,1,"Description:
EasyCarbo is an extremely powerful and effective carbon source for aquarium plants.

Volume:
250ml500ml1ltr

Features & Benefits:Carbon (in the form of CO2 dissolved in the water) is one of the most important nutrients for optimal plant growth. If there is a lack of carbon, plants are not able to optimally assimilate and grow. As a result of this deficiency, plants stop growing and no longer compete with algae for the nutrients. If this carbon deficiency lasts for too  long, then plants start to leak sugars and other nutrients which attract  algae. As a result, leaves become covered in algae and look  unattractive. EasyCarbo is the solution to this problem. After  approximately two weeks of using EasyCarbo, plants visibly grow better  and look better. This is particularly true of swamp plants (Cryptocoryne  sp., Echinodorus sp., etcetera). As a result of the increased  competition for nutrients, algae find it very difficult to survive and,  in most cases, they disappear altogether.Directions:Every Day - 1ml per 50 Liters, up to 2ml per 50 Liters Daily

Flourish Nitrogen,1,"Description:
Nitrogen is one of the main three macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium: NPK) required by plants and can often become the limiting factor to growth in a ﬂourishing system. Flourish Nitrogen™ is a concentrated (15,000 mg/L) blend of nitrogen sources. It provides nitrogen in both the nitrate form and the plant–preferred ammonium form. However, no free ammonia is released because the ammonium in Flourish Nitrogen™ is complexed and unavailable until utilized by the plants. Flourish Nitrogen™ also provides nitrate for those plants that can readily utilize nitrate as well. For maximum benefit, use with Flourish Phosphorus™ and Flourish Potassium™. Flourish Nitrogen™ is safe for invertebrates such as shrimp.

Volume: 

100ml250ml

Features & Benefits:
Nitrogen supplement for the planted aquarium.15,000 mg/L blend of nitrogen sources.Provides nitrogen in both the nitrate form and the ammonium form.Directions:Beginner: 
Use 2.5 mL (half a cap) for each 160 L (40 US gallons) twice a week or as needed in response to signs of nitrogen deficiency (e.g. stunted growth, chlorosis). For smaller doses, please note that each cap thread is approximately 1 mL.Expert: 
The beginner dose raises nitrogen by the same degree that 1 mg/L nitrate would. This dose is sufficient to provide approximately 4 g of growth (dry) or about 20 g (hydrated) over a 1 month period (assuming all other necessary nutrients are provided). For increased growth use proportionately more.To target a specific nitrogen increase, dose according to the following formula: 0.25vn=m, where v= volume of tank in gallons, n=desired nitrogen increase (if using a “nitrate equivalent” value for “n” then use a factor of 0.05 instead of 0.25 in the formula) and m=volume of product to use in mL. For example to raise 20 gallons by 0.20 mg/L nitrogen you would use: 0.25*20*0.20=1 mL.Because one-half of the nitrogen in Flourish Nitrogen™ is from nitrate you can get a reasonable estimate of nitrogen levels by doubling a nitrate readin"
Flourish Phosphorus,1,"Description:
Phosphorus is one of the main three macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium: NPK) required by plants and can often become the limiting factor to growth in a ﬂourishing system. Flourish Phosphorus™ is a safe solution (4,500 mg/L phosphate) of potassium phosphate that takes the guesswork out of phosphate dosing. Unlike competing products that mix nitrate and phosphate in a fixed ratio, Flourish Phosphorus™ (being nitrate free) allows you to dose phosphorus according to the needs of your plants without the risk of overdosing nitrates. When used as directed, Flourish Phosphorus™will enhance and accelerate the growth of aquatic plants without enhancing algae growth. For maximum benefit, use with Flourish Nitrogen™ and Flourish Potassium™. Flourish Phosphorus™ is safe for invertebrates such as shrimp.

Volume:
100ml250ml

Features & Benefits:
Phosphorus supplement for the planted aquarium.A safe 4500 mg/L solution of potassium phosphate.Takes the guesswork out of phosphate dosing.Directions: Beginner: Use 2.5 mL (half a cap) for each 80 L (20 US gallons) once  or twice a week or as needed in response to signs of phosphorus  deficiency (e.g. stunted growth, plant dark green).Expert: The beginner dose raises phosphorus by 0.05 mg/L (0.15 mg/L phosphate). The ideal phosphate level will vary, but generally ranges from 0.15–1.0 mg/L. Use MultiTest™: Phosphate to monitor phosphate levels. To target a specific phosphate increase, dose according to the following formula: 0.8vp=m, where v= volume of tank in gallons, p=desired phosphate increase and m=volume of product to use in mL. For example to raise 20 gallons to 0.1 mg/L phosphate you would use: 0.8*20*0.1=1.6 m"
Flourish Potassium,1,"Description:
Flourish Potassium™ contains 50,000 mg/L of potassium suitable for the natural planted aquarium. Potassium is one of several elements that are vitally important to maintaining a vigorous level of growth in a planted aquarium.

Features & Benefits:
Perfect Starter Pack for Beginners.Contains 100 ML Bottles of Flourish, Flourish IRON, and Flourish ExcelBroad Spectrum, Iron, and Carbon

Flourish® is a growth stimulator for aquarium plant stems and leaves. It contains a broad spectrum of essential trace elements, vitamins, and amino acids. Flourish® is rich in gluconate iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, potassium, inositol, choline B12, biotin, and other factors that have been determined to be beneficial to aquatic plants.

Flourish Iron™ is a companion product to Flourish™ and Flourish Tabs™. It is a complexed ferrous (Fe+2) iron product which contains 10,000 mg/L of iron and is ideal for iron maintenance in the natural planted aquarium. Plants can utilize both ferric (Fe+3) and ferrous (Fe+2) iron, although they prefer ferrous iron when available.

Flourish Excel™ is a simple source of readily available organic carbon. All plants require a source of carbon. This is typically obtained from CO2, but, may also be obtained via relatively simple organic compounds (such as photosynthetic intermediates). Since both processes occur simultaneously one can derive a substantial benefit with the use of Flourish Excel™ either alone or in conjunction with CO2 injection.

De Nitrate,1,"Description:
de*nitrate™ is an economical, natural, porous material with a pore distribution and geometry that promotes both aerobic nitrification within the first few millimeters of depth and anaerobic denitrification at the core. The material has a high surface area and supports a high density of bacteria. Although de*nitrate™ has capacity to trap nitrate, this, as with other nitrate retaining materials, such as certain zeolites and synthetic resins, is quite limited and the primary mechanism of nitrate removal is anaerobic.

Volume:
100ml (Bagged)250ml500ml

Features & Benefits:
Removes Nitrates, Nitrites, Ammonia, and OrganicsHigh Porosity Biological MediaPore Size Well Suited for Anaerobic BacteriaNo Danger of Hydrogen Sulfide Production as with Sulfur Based MediaDirections:For best results, de*nitrate™ should be placed to assure the flow of water through it, such as in a canister filter, chemical filtration module, or box filter. Flow rate should not exceed 200 L (50 US gallons) per hour. If higher flow rates are unavoidable, use Matrix™ or Pond Matrix™. It is best to rinse off dust before use. Once de*nitrate™ has been in use for several days, nitrate concentrations should start to fall and level off gradually at a concentration of about 4–5 mg/L as nitrate. As long as nitrate concentrations remain under control, the product is not exhausted. Each 500 mL of de*nitrate™ treats about 100–200 L (25–50 US gallons), depending on initial nitrate concentration and the current biological load. Enough should be used to remove nitrate at a rate at least as fast as the rate of formation. If very high nitrates are initially present, they should be brought down to less than 20 mg/L with water change"

AmGuard,1,"Description:
AmGuard safely, rapidly and efﬁciently removes toxic free ammonia. It is safe to use during tank cycling and is ideal for treating emergency situations. AmGuard is the strongest liquid ammonia binder on the market. It works within minutes to detoxify free ammonia, and it doesn’t degrade for nearly 72 hours. That’s at least twice as long as our competitors’ products. Unlike competing products, AmGuard™ converts it into a safe, non-toxic form that is readily removed by the tank’s biofilter. It does not alter pH. Ammonia can exist in two forms: free and ionized. It is only the free form that is toxic. Traditional ammonia test kits convert all ammonia to free ammonia by raising pH to 12–14; at this pH AmGuard cannot function and thus a false positive reading will result. For long term ammonia control, use Seachem Stability and Matrix. Use Ammonia Alert or MultiTest: Free & Total Ammonia to directly monitor levels of free ammonia. AmGuard™ also removes chlorine and chloramines.

Volume:
100ml250ml500ml

Features & Benefits:
Detoxifies Ammonia for up to 48 hours.Ideal for emergency situations.More effective than any other ammonia-binding product.Most concentrated product on the market.Directions: Use 1 capful (5 mL) for every 200 L (50 US gallons) daily or as needed to reduce ammonia. Advanced: If you have an Ammonia Alert that is reading “Alert”, then use 1 capful (5 mL) for every 400 L (100 gallons) daily. If it reads “Alarm”, then use 1 capful for every 200 L (50 gallons) daily. If it reads “Toxic”, then use 1 capful for every 80 L (20 gallons) daily.Expert: If using our MultiTest: Free & Total Ammonia test kit, use 1 capful (5 mL) for every 40 L (10 gallons) to remove 1 mg/L (ppm) of free ammonia. Alternatively you may employ the following formula for a variety of ammonia and water levels: 0.125AV=m (for volume in liters) or 0.5AV=m (for volume in gallons). A=ammonia concentration in mg/L, V=the volume of water being treated and m=the volume of AmGuard™ to use in mL. For example, to remove 1 mg/L of ammonia in 100 gallons you would use 0.5*1*100=50 mL.If water temperature is above 30 °C (86 °F) do not us"

Cupramine,1,"Description:
Cupramine effectively eradicates Oodinium, Cryptocaryon, Amyloodinium, Ichthyophthirius, and other ectoparasites of both freshwater and marine fish. It is superior to copper sulfate, chloride & citrate: it is non-acidic, less toxic to fish, remains in solution, and does not contaminate the filter bed. It is superior to chelates: it is fully charged (ionic), active at low concentrations, and is removable with carbon.

Volume:
50ml100ml

Features & Benefits:
Copper treatment for external parasites.Active at low concentration (does not precipitate).Bound on amine so it is not as toxic to fish.100% Removable with carbon or Cuprisorb.

Directions:
Before Treating Remove all invertebrates - these are extremely sensitive to copper and will not tolerate treatment with a copper-based medication. Turn off UV filters, ozone filters, and remove chemical filtration like MatrixCarbon and Purigen. Do not use in conjunction with any other medication. Do not use any products which contain reducing agents (conditioners, ammonia binders, etc.) while using Cupramine.

Treatment
If the bottle has a dropper cap, use 20 drops (1 mL) per 40 L (10.5 US gallons) the first day, wait 48 hours, then repeat. On non-dropper caps, each inner ring is 1 mL. In freshwater use half dose. Final copper concentration is 0.5 mg/L (0.25 mg/L in freshwater). Leave at this concentration for 14 days. Do not redose without testing (MultiTest™: Copper). If tank has ever been treated with an ionic copper (e.g. copper chloride, sulfate or citrate), test copper level after initial dosing. Although most fish tolerate Cupramine™ to 0.8 mg/L, it is not advisable to exceed 0.6 mg/L copper.

Finish the Full Treatment Ich, velvet, and many other parasites spend a large portion of their life cycle as a cyst that is immune to medication and hiding in the substrate of your tank. Remember that you need to finish the full treatment even if you can’t see parasites on the fish!

After Treating Cupramine can be removed using carbon or CupriSorb. Leave the copper-absorbing media in your tank for at least a week after the copper concentration has reached 0 to ensure all traces of the medication have been completely remove"
De Nitrate,1,"Description:
de*nitrate™ is an economical, natural, porous material with a pore distribution and geometry that promotes both aerobic nitrification within the first few millimeters of depth and anaerobic denitrification at the core. The material has a high surface area and supports a high density of bacteria. Although de*nitrate™ has capacity to trap nitrate, this, as with other nitrate retaining materials, such as certain zeolites and synthetic resins, is quite limited and the primary mechanism of nitrate removal is anaerobic.

Volume:
100ml (Bagged)250ml500ml

Features & Benefits:
Removes Nitrates, Nitrites, Ammonia, and OrganicsHigh Porosity Biological MediaPore Size Well Suited for Anaerobic BacteriaNo Danger of Hydrogen Sulfide Production as with Sulfur Based MediaDirections:For best results, de*nitrate™ should be placed to assure the flow of water through it, such as in a canister filter, chemical filtration module, or box filter. Flow rate should not exceed 200 L (50 US gallons) per hour. If higher flow rates are unavoidable, use Matrix™ or Pond Matrix™. It is best to rinse off dust before use. Once de*nitrate™ has been in use for several days, nitrate concentrations should start to fall and level off gradually at a concentration of about 4–5 mg/L as nitrate. As long as nitrate concentrations remain under control, the product is not exhausted. Each 500 mL of de*nitrate™ treats about 100–200 L (25–50 US gallons), depending on initial nitrate concentration and the current biological load. Enough should be used to remove nitrate at a rate at least as fast as the rate of formation. If very high nitrates are initially present, they should be brought down to less than 20 mg/L with water change"

Flourish Nitrogen,1,"Description:
Nitrogen is one of the main three macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium: NPK) required by plants and can often become the limiting factor to growth in a ﬂourishing system. Flourish Nitrogen™ is a concentrated (15,000 mg/L) blend of nitrogen sources. It provides nitrogen in both the nitrate form and the plant–preferred ammonium form. However, no free ammonia is released because the ammonium in Flourish Nitrogen™ is complexed and unavailable until utilized by the plants. Flourish Nitrogen™ also provides nitrate for those plants that can readily utilize nitrate as well. For maximum benefit, use with Flourish Phosphorus™ and Flourish Potassium™. Flourish Nitrogen™ is safe for invertebrates such as shrimp.

Volume: 

100ml250ml

Features & Benefits:
Nitrogen supplement for the planted aquarium.15,000 mg/L blend of nitrogen sources.Provides nitrogen in both the nitrate form and the ammonium form.Directions:Beginner: 
Use 2.5 mL (half a cap) for each 160 L (40 US gallons) twice a week or as needed in response to signs of nitrogen deficiency (e.g. stunted growth, chlorosis). For smaller doses, please note that each cap thread is approximately 1 mL.Expert: 
The beginner dose raises nitrogen by the same degree that 1 mg/L nitrate would. This dose is sufficient to provide approximately 4 g of growth (dry) or about 20 g (hydrated) over a 1 month period (assuming all other necessary nutrients are provided). For increased growth use proportionately more.To target a specific nitrogen increase, dose according to the following formula: 0.25vn=m, where v= volume of tank in gallons, n=desired nitrogen increase (if using a “nitrate equivalent” value for “n” then use a factor of 0.05 instead of 0.25 in the formula) and m=volume of product to use in mL. For example to raise 20 gallons by 0.20 mg/L nitrogen you would use: 0.25*20*0.20=1 mL.Because one-half of the nitrogen in Flourish Nitrogen™ is from nitrate you can get a reasonable estimate of nitrogen levels by doubling a nitrate readin"
Flourish Phosphorus,1,"Description:
Phosphorus is one of the main three macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium: NPK) required by plants and can often become the limiting factor to growth in a ﬂourishing system. Flourish Phosphorus™ is a safe solution (4,500 mg/L phosphate) of potassium phosphate that takes the guesswork out of phosphate dosing. Unlike competing products that mix nitrate and phosphate in a fixed ratio, Flourish Phosphorus™ (being nitrate free) allows you to dose phosphorus according to the needs of your plants without the risk of overdosing nitrates. When used as directed, Flourish Phosphorus™will enhance and accelerate the growth of aquatic plants without enhancing algae growth. For maximum benefit, use with Flourish Nitrogen™ and Flourish Potassium™. Flourish Phosphorus™ is safe for invertebrates such as shrimp.

Volume:
100ml250ml

Features & Benefits:
Phosphorus supplement for the planted aquarium.A safe 4500 mg/L solution of potassium phosphate.Takes the guesswork out of phosphate dosing.Directions: Beginner: Use 2.5 mL (half a cap) for each 80 L (20 US gallons) once  or twice a week or as needed in response to signs of phosphorus  deficiency (e.g. stunted growth, plant dark green).Expert: The beginner dose raises phosphorus by 0.05 mg/L (0.15 mg/L phosphate). The ideal phosphate level will vary, but generally ranges from 0.15–1.0 mg/L. Use MultiTest™: Phosphate to monitor phosphate levels. To target a specific phosphate increase, dose according to the following formula: 0.8vp=m, where v= volume of tank in gallons, p=desired phosphate increase and m=volume of product to use in mL. For example to raise 20 gallons to 0.1 mg/L phosphate you would use: 0.8*20*0.1=1.6 m"
Flourish Potassium,1,"Description:
Flourish Potassium™ contains 50,000 mg/L of potassium suitable for the natural planted aquarium. Potassium is one of several elements that are vitally important to maintaining a vigorous level of growth in a planted aquarium.

Directions:
May generate heat on initial contact with water. Pre-wet by adding to a double volume of freshwater, followed by a rinse. For best results, PhosGuard™ should be rinsed before use and placed so as to maximize the flow of water through it but not so that it tumbles against itself in flow. It may be used in a canister filter, media chamber, box filter, or any high flow area of a trickle filter. Use of a filter bag is recommended. Use 85 mL (1/3 cup) for every 200 L (50 US gallons) saltwater or 400 L (100 US gallons) freshwater.

Leave product in place for 4 days, then test phosphate or silicate concentrations with either MultiTest™: Phosphate or MultiTest™: Silicate. If the concentration of the component you are trying to decrease has not dropped to around 0.02 mg/L, then replace the PhosGuard™, otherwise leave in place until levels begin to climb again. As long as concentrations remain under control, the product is not exhausted. Over treating is not recommended. PhosGuard™ is not an exchange resin and does not release anything into the water. It does not leach phosphate or silicate back into the water and may be removed, dried, and returned to service until exhausted.

Plant Pack LV2 (Enhancer NPK),4,"Description:
Plant Pack Enhancer: NPK combines Flourish Nitrogen™, Flourish Phosphorus™, and Flourish Potassium™.

Features & Benefits:
Perfect Starter Pack for Beginners.Contains 100 ML Bottles of Flourish, Flourish IRON, and Flourish ExcelBroad Spectrum, Iron, and Carbon

Flourish Nitrogen™ is a concentrated (15,000 mg/L) blend of nitrogen sources. It provides nitrogen in both the nitrate form and the plant-preferred ammonium form. However, no free ammonia is released because the ammonium in Flourish Nitrogen™ is complexed and unavailable until utilized by the plants. Flourish Nitrogen™ also provides nitrate for those plants that can readily utilize nitrate as well.

Flourish Phosphorus™ is a safe solution of potassium phosphate that takes the guesswork out phosphate dosing. Unlike competing products that mix nitrate and phosphate in a fixed ratio, Flourish Phosphorus™ (being nitrate free) allows you to dose phosphorus according to the needs of your plants without the risk of overdosing nitrates. Likewise, because Flourish Nitrogen™ is phosphate free you can use both products together to target exactly the ideal amounts of each for your system.

Flourish Potassium™ contains 40,000 mg/L of potassium suitable for the natural freshwater aquarium. Potassium is an important element that is needed by all plants. In a thriving planted aquarium it can become the limiting factor to growth if it is depleted.

Plant Pack LV1 (Fundamentals),1,"Description:
Plant Pack™: Fundamentals is an excellent pack for beginning aquatic gardeners. It contains Flourish®, Flourish Iron™, Flourish Excel™.

Features & Benefits:
Perfect Starter Pack for Beginners.Contains 100 ML Bottles of Flourish, Flourish IRON, and Flourish ExcelBroad Spectrum, Iron, and Carbon

Flourish® is a growth stimulator for aquarium plant stems and leaves. It contains a broad spectrum of essential trace elements, vitamins, and amino acids. Flourish® is rich in gluconate iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, potassium, inositol, choline B12, biotin, and other factors that have been determined to be beneficial to aquatic plants.

Flourish Iron™ is a companion product to Flourish™ and Flourish Tabs™. It is a complexed ferrous (Fe+2) iron product which contains 10,000 mg/L of iron and is ideal for iron maintenance in the natural planted aquarium. Plants can utilize both ferric (Fe+3) and ferrous (Fe+2) iron, although they prefer ferrous iron when available.

Flourish Excel™ is a simple source of readily available organic carbon. All plants require a source of carbon. This is typically obtained from CO2, but, may also be obtained via relatively simple organic compounds (such as photosynthetic intermediates). Since both processes occur simultaneously one can derive a substantial benefit with the use of Flourish Excel™ either alone or in conjunction with CO2 injection.

Pond Matrix,1,"Description:
Pond Matrix™ is a high porosity bio media that provides efficient biofiltration for the removal of nitrogenous waste in ponds. Plastic bio-materials provide only external surface area, whereas Pond Matrix™ provides internal macroporous surface area. These macropores are ideally sized for the support of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. This allows Pond Matrix™, unlike other forms of biomedia, to remove nitrate along with ammonia and nitrite, simultaneously and in the same filter. Pond Matrix™ is completely inert and will not breakdown. It need not be replaced. It is also more suitable for use as a clean soil replacement for growing pond plants. Use 1–2 Liters of Pond Matrix™ for each 100 US gallons. Since the majority of the bacteria are internal, Pond Matrix™ may be rinsed when needed without damaging the filter. Pond Matrix™ is compatible with all types of wet or wet-dry filters.

Volume:

Features & Benefits:
High Capacity BiofiltrationControls Ammonia, Nitrite, and NitrateHighly Porous - Enormous Surface Area (160,000 cm2/L)Supports Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacteria SpeciesDirections:For filtration use 2 Liters of Pond Matrix™ for each 200 gallons of water. Use in any pond filter. Pond Matrix™ is sufficiently large that a filter bag should not be necessary. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for your filter. Pond Matrix™ should never need replacing. Pond Matrix™ makes an excellent support for root development of aquatic plants and may be used directly on the bottom of the pond or in pots. This avoids the use of soil in the pond. It may be used alone, mixed, or overlayed with river rock. For pond bottom use, it should be presoaked for several days and allowed to become waterlogged and sink (although a high current will disrupt it). Pond Matrix™ is inorganic and will not decompose or pollute the wate"

Purigen,1,"Description:
Purigen® is a premium synthetic adsorbent that is unlike any other  filtration product. It is not a mixture of ion exchangers or adsorbents,  but a unique macro-porous synthetic polymer that removes soluble and  insoluble impurities from water at a rate and capacity that exceeds all  other competing products by over 500%. Purigen® controls ammonia,  nitrites and nitrates by removing nitrogenous organic waste that would  otherwise release these harmful compounds. Purigen impact on trace  elements is minimal. It significantly raises redox. It polishes water to  unparalleled clarity. Purigen® darkens progressively as it exhausts,  and is easily renewed by treating with bleach. Purigen® is designed for  both marine and freshwater use.

Volume:
100ml (Bagged)250ml500ml

Features & Benefits:
Highest Organic Removal CapacityPossesses Enhanced Capacity Owing to Its Vast Surface Area; Both Spherical and MacroreticularHelps Control Ammonia/Nitrite/NitrateColor Changes as It Exhausts; Easily RegeneratedSelectivity:Purigen® is the highest capacity  organic filtration resin on the market. No other products can compare to  its ability to clear haziness and polish water to unparalleled clarity.  Unlike other products on the market which are simple ion-exchange  resins, Purigen® is specifically designed to be an organic scavenging  resin. When ion-exchange resins are filled to capacity by metals and  other contaminants, Purigen® has barely begun to reach its potential.  Purigen® generally ignores simple elemental compounds, having an extreme  affinity for nitrogenous organics. The primary source of nitrogenous  compounds in an aquarium is waste. Fish, corals, even plants produce  nitrogenous waste. Purigen® removes that waste faster and more  completely than anything else on the market.  Capacity:Purigen’s™ possesses enhanced  capacity owing to its vast surface area. All other resins on the market  are purely spherical extruded beads. These beads remain smooth even  under a microscope. Purigen® is both spherical and macroreticular. It  has microscopic pores that increase its usable surface area to many  times that of a purely spherical resin. Regeneration:Purigen® can also be  regenerated. As it absorbs waste products, Purigen® will change color  from a pale blonde to a dark brown, almost black. Once it is exhausted,  it can be regenerated with a solution of bleach and water. The bleach  will literally “burn off” the organics that have been removed from the  tank. Watch out for products that claim to be regenerable with a brine  solution. That is the regeneration procedure for ion-exchange purposes. A  brine solution will not remove organics. While such resins have a  limited capacity for organic adsorption, a brine regeneration process  only replaces removed ionic compounds. It does not destroy large organic  molecules that were removed, which is the primary function of organic  adsorption resins.Directions: Rinse before use. Use in a fine mesh (180 micron or less) filter bag such as Seachem’s The Bag™.  Each 250 mL treats up to 1,000 L (250 US gallons) for up to six months.  Exhaustion is indicated by a pronounced discoloration of the beads to  dark brown or black.Regeneration:Soak in a 1:1 bleach:water solution for 24  hours in a non-metallic container in a well ventilated area and away  from children. Use regular 8.25% hypochlorite household bleach  (non-scented, no dyes, do not use a splash-less bleach). Rinse well,  then soak for 8 hours with a solution containing 4 tablespoons of Prime®,  or equivalent dechlorinator per cup of water. Rinse well. For  freshwater use, soak for 4 hours with a solution containing 2  tablespoons of buffer per cup of water (Discus Buffer®, Neutral Regulator®).  Original color and full activity should now be restored and Purigen® is  ready for reuse. Caution: some slime coat products may permanently foul  Purigen® and render regeneration difficult. Do not reuse if odor of  bleach/chlorine is detectable. In case of doubt, soak beads in small  quantity of water and test for residual chlorine with a chlorine test  ki"

Stress Guard,4,"Description:
StressGuard is the premium slime coat protection product. StressGuard will reduce stress and ammonia toxicity whenever handling or  transporting ﬁsh. StressGuard binds to exposed protein in wounds to  promote healing of injured ﬁsh and to reduce the likelihood of primary  and secondary infections. StressGuard is compatible with all  medications except those that are copper based. StressGuard is not  amine based and will not interfere with Purigen; or HyperSorb regeneration. StressGuard does not coat resins or clog ﬁltration like competing “slime coat” type products can.

Volume:
100ml250ml500ml

Features & Benefits:
Reduces Stress When Handling or Transporting FishAntiseptic for FishPromotes HealingMarine and FreshwaterWhat makes StressGuard very successful at healing is the fact that it  contains protein active colloids. This protein active colloidal agent  actively seeks out any wounds, abrasions, or places where exposed  proteins are and attaches to this area to help directly deliver the  disinfectant in the product and start the healing process. This protein  active colloid, because it binds to the exposed proteins, also acts like  a liquid bandage to the abrasion. Some products are marketed to be  squirted in the bag when a fish is purchased. Those products are  generally acidic, with some brands being a very strong acid. Putting  such a product in a small, enclosed container with a fish often does  more harm than any intended good. StressGuard has a pH of 7.0. It will  not affect the pH of an aquarium, even at large doses. There are no  other products on the market that can compare to the effectiveness of  StressGuard. Directions: Use 1/2–1 capful (2.5–5 mL) to every 40 L (10 US gallons) daily until  signs of stress have abated or healing is complete.  Dose may be safely  doubled. "

Easy-Life Voogle 250mls,1,"Description:
Voogle is an  innovative product that helps to keep fish healthy and improves their  immune system. Using Voogle will limit the use of antibiotics to a  minimum. The natural immune system is stimulated, so that fish are  better protected against diseases.

Directions for Use:
Voogle has no harmful effect on fish, shrimps, lobsters, molluscs, plants or the biofilter.

Voogle has no effect on the important water parameters and does not cause resistance.

Voogle mostly consists of plant extracts and supporting vitamins and minerals.

Voogle breaks down naturally, so that it is not necessary to change the water after using the product.

Every fish has a natural immune system against pathogens.  Transportation, dirty water or a high number of pathogens in the water  cause a lot of stress. Stress costs a great deal of energy and has a  negative effect on the immune system. The mucous skin, gills and fins,  in particular, become more sensitive to diseases, such as white spot,  fungi and other types of infection. Weekly use of Voogle ensures that  fish remain optimally protected in a natural way and the dangers  resulting from pathogens are greatly reduced. 

Tips for Usage:
Maintenance, continuous protection	10 ml Voogle per 100 litres aquarium water every week.

Transport	10 ml per 40 litres during (long-distance) transport.

Quarantine - import	Five-day course treatment, 10 ml per 40 litres.

New fish in aquarium	Double dose, 10 ml per 20 litres.

In case of problems	Five-day course treatment, 10 ml per 40 litres.

*** Voogle is extremely safe to use and multiple doses can be  added in one go if the situation requires. The course of treatment can  also be extended without any problem"
